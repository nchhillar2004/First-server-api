## Reporting a Vulnerability

At iNotebook, we take security seriously. If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our application or website, please help us by following these steps:

**Do Not** create a public issue or disclosure on GitHub for security vulnerabilities. 

Instead, please report the issue to me privately via email. You can reach us at [nchhillar2004@gmail.com](nchhillar2004@gmail.com). When reporting, please provide the following information:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any supporting evidence or proof of concept.

Our team will review your report and respond promptly. We appreciate your responsible disclosure and will keep you informed throughout the resolution process.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you follow responsible disclosure practices when reporting security vulnerabilities to us. This includes:

- Not exploiting the vulnerability or sharing it with others.
- Not disclosing the issue publicly until we've had a chance to address it.
- Providing us with a reasonable amount of time to investigate and resolve the issue before any public disclosure.

We are committed to maintaining the security and privacy of our users, and we greatly appreciate your assistance in this matter.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank all security researchers and contributors who help us maintain the security of iNotebook. Your efforts are invaluable in keeping our platform safe for everyone.
